# Scantron Dev

## Purpose
This is a project for rewriting the Kansas State University Help Desk scantron program to be more legible and user-friendly. The original program requires users to navigate through the command prompt. This new version uses Windows Application Forms for a less confusing user experience.

The TS-SCAN folder contains all of the files from the original program written in 1987. Retrieved from Niel Erdwien.

Error fixing and detailed information on the architecture of the program and its methods are on the wiki page: https://github.com/prometheus1994/scantron-dev/wiki
